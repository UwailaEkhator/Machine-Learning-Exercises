Power Iteration method is advantageous here because it is more computationally efficient, because it does not involve complex decompositions or operations. Therfore it converges faster. Also the power method is an iterative method, unlike the SVD, so we do not need to compute all principal components at once. This makes it faster."

    "#### Explanation of Overfitting\n",
    "A model that fits the training data too well is said to be overfitting. When a model learns so much about the detail and noise in the training data that it adversely affects the model's performance on fresh data, this is known as overfitting. This indicates that the model detects and interprets noise or random oscillations in the training set as concepts. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the models ability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Underfitting\n",
    "A model that is underfit is one that is unable to accurately represent the training set or make inferences from data it has not seen before. A machine learning model that is underfit is unsuitable as it will perform poorly on the training set. Underfitting is often not discussed as it is easy to detect given a good performance metric. The remedy is to move on and try alternate machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, it does provide a good contrast to the problem of overfitting.\n",

It can be explained as the degree of correct classification that the algorithm has to meet, it controls the tradeoff between correctly classifying datapoints and a smooth decision boundary. A larger C, means the model chooses more data points as support vectors, this may cause the problem of overfitting, and a smaller C may lead to underfitting. We need to choose an optimal C.\n",

    "Graph kernels are used to generalize Support Vector Machines, so they are able to work with graphs. There are different kinds of graph kernels: Random walk kernel, Weisfeiler-Leman graph kernel, shortest path kernel, etc\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "##### A general framework on how Graph Kernels work:\n",
    "For instance we have a collection of graphs that represent various things, and we want to classify these graphs based on what they represent i.e. their labels using an SVM. Because this data is Non-linear we have to convert it into a liner form so we can use SVM, this is were a Graph kernel comes in.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When we define a kernel function, it would compute the similarity between all pairs of graphs, and store the scores in  Gram matrix aka kernel matrix. $ G_{ij} = \\langle \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\rangle$ where $x_{i} and x_{j} $ represents every pair of graphs.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Now that we have the Gram matrix, we can apply the SVM. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Reference 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-on-graphs-part-3-b968e1cc1aa3)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explaining how a random walk kernel works:\n",
    "Random walks are performed on a pair of graphs, and then number of matching walks are counted. If we have two node-labeled graphs $G_{i} = (V_{i}, E_{i})$ and $G_{j} = (V_{j}, E_{j})$ , their direct product $G_{x} = (V_{x}, E_{x})$ is a graph with vertex set: <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "##### How it works\n",
    "The string kernal function works by measuring the similarity of pairs of string, and storing them in $K(a,b)$. The higher the similarity between two strings, the higher the value of $K(a,b)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### How the Lodhi String Kernel works\n",
    "The way it works is that if given two text documents, it compares them by means of the substrings they contain. The more substrings in commons, the higher the similarity level.  They also introduced a decay factor $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$ to handle non-contiguous substrings. This sub-strings do not have to be necessarily contiguous, but the level of contiguity in a sub-string in a document will determine the amount of weight it will have in the comparison. For instance: the sub-string ‘c-a-r’ appears in both ‘card’ and ‘custard’, but with different weighting.\n",

    "The function sigmoid_kernel computes the sigmoid kernel between two vectors. The sigmoid kernel is also known as hyperbolic tangent, or Multilayer Perceptron (because, in the neural network field, it is often used as neuron activation function). <br>\n",
    "The sigmoid kernel can model non-linear and sigmoidal relationships between the data points, and it can approximate the neural network activation function. It’s particularly suited for problems where the decision boundary is expected to be S-shaped or take on a sigmoidal form.\n",
    "It works by taking your input, mapping them to a value of 0 and 1 so that they can be separated by a simple straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$k(x,y) = tanh(\\gamma x^{T}y + c_{0})$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "where: <br>\n",
    "x, y are the input vectors <br>\n",
    "$\\gamma $ is known as slope <br>\n",
    "$c_{0}$ is known as intercept, It is the central vertical bias that changes the height of the kernel’s output for inputs near the origin. It shifts the operating point on the sigmoid, affecting the relative emphasis of the angle between the inputs.<br>\n",
    "tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we have two feature vectors $x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\\\ x_2\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.\\\\x_n \\end{bmatrix}$ and $y = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1\\\\y_2\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.\\\\y_n \\end{bmatrix}$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters '$\\gamma $' and '$c_{0}$' are pivotal and need careful tuning to ensure model accuracy, finding the right values for these parameters can be a challenge. Another thing to note is that sigmoid kernel usually works better for binary classifications than multiclass.\n",
